# PartyPulse

PartyPulse provides users with the ability to connect with other gamers based on what games they are wanting to find partymates for. Users can separate themselves within the "PartyPulse" by what teammates they are looking for. Gamers sometimes have a hard time finding teammates so we want to make a quick and easy experience, while also making friendships in the app, in games, and possibly real-life. Our application aims to tackle the goal of finding friends to play with, no matter what playstyle, region, or experience level.
